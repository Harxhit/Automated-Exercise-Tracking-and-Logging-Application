# Automated Exercise Tracking and Logging Application

## Description
Developed an automated application that integrates with Nutritionix API to track and log exercises. The application queries the user for their exercise routines, calculates nutritional data such as calories burned, and logs this information into a Google Sheets document using Sheety API. The system ensures accurate tracking and easy access to exercise data for monitoring progress and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for scripting and automation.
- **Requests Library:** To handle HTTP requests and interact with external APIs.
- **Nutritionix API:** To analyze and fetch detailed nutritional data for various exercises.
- **Sheety API:** To log the exercise data into a Google Sheets document.
- **Datetime Module:** For handling and formatting dates and times.
- **JSON:** For data exchange between the APIs and the application.
- **Basic Authentication:** For secure access to the Sheety API.

## Features
- **User Interaction:** Prompts the user to input the types of exercises performed.
- **Data Analysis:** Sends exercise data to Nutritionix API to get detailed information such as duration and calories burned.
- **Automated Logging:** Logs the fetched data into a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and reference.
- **Date and Time Stamping:** Records the date and time of each exercise entry to keep a detailed log.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **API Integration:** Efficiently integrated multiple APIs to fetch and log data.
- **HTTP Requests Handling:** Utilized the `requests` library to send and receive data from APIs.
- **Data Parsing and Handling:** Processed JSON data to extract necessary information.
- **Automation:** Automated the logging process, ensuring seamless data entry into Google Sheets.
- **Problem-Solving:** Addressed potential errors in API interactions and logging, ensuring reliability.
- **Time Management:** Managed time-based data logging, maintaining an accurate and up-to-date exercise log.

## Project Outcome
This project showcases proficiency in Python, API integration, and automation. The application provides users with an efficient way to track their exercise routines and monitor their fitness progress. By leveraging external APIs and automated data logging, it enhances user experience and promotes a healthy lifestyle.
